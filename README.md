🍕 # SQL Project – Pizza Hut Sales Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a Pizza Hut sales dataset using SQL. The goal is to extract business insights from raw transactional data by writing efficient SQL queries.
It covers queries from basic to advanced level, demonstrating how SQL can help answer real-world business questions.

🔎 Objectives

The analysis is divided into three levels:

Basic Queries

Retrieve the total number of orders placed

Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales

Identify the highest-priced pizza

Find the most common pizza size ordered

List the top 5 most ordered pizzas with quantities

Intermediate Queries

Find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered

Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day

Get category-wise distribution of pizzas

Calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day

Find the top 3 pizzas by revenue

Advanced Queries

Calculate the % contribution of each pizza type to total revenue

Analyze cumulative revenue generated over time

Find the top 3 pizzas by revenue in each category
